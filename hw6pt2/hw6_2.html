<h1>Homework 6: Census data ratio choropleth </h1>
<h2>Julia Straight</h2>
<h3>These maps depict the ratio of men above 25 in Virginia who have completed a Bachelor's degree by county. I created a ratio of men in that county who had completed a bachelor's to the total number of men in that county. I created that ratio so that we could see how common bachelor's degrees are by county, and be able to account for some counties being less populated than other counties. The pure number of men with bachelor's degrees by county may have made it look like men are more educated in counties with higher populations. With this ratio, we can directly compare counties with higher populations to counties with lower populations.  </h3>
